# üåç Global GDP Analysis & Visualization using Python

This is a project I worked on to explore and visualize GDP data for different countries across several years. The idea was to understand how countries' economies have grown over time, compare them, and visualize those trends using interactive graphs.

I used two Python scripts  ‚Äî one for analysis and one for visualizations ‚Äî based on a CSV dataset (`gdp.csv`).

## What this project does

- Calculates GDP growth for every country year by year
- Analyzes trends for specific countries like India, China, and the World
- Compares GDP between countries using line graphs
- Creates HTML-based interactive charts for individual and grouped countries
- Saves all visualizations locally for easy sharing/viewing

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas (for data manipulation)  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)  
- Jupyter Notebook 

---

## Files Included

### `GDP Analysis.py`
- Cleaned and explored the data
- Calculated GDP growth percentages
- Checked GDP changes for countries like India, Arab World, and World
- Found countries with highest average and peak GDP

### `GDP Visualization.py`
- Created GDP graphs for each country individually
- Compared GDPs of selected countries (like India, China, USA, etc.)
- Built a function to generate custom comparison charts
- Created GDP growth plots and saved everything as HTML files

## A Few Things I Explored

- Which countries had the fastest GDP growth?
- How India‚Äôs GDP changed over time
- Global GDP comparison from 1960 to 2016
- Easiest way to generate GDP growth graphs with a few lines of code

## Some Output Files

* `World GDP.html`
* `Indian GDP.html`
* `GDP Indivisual/<country>.html`
* `GDP Growth.html`
* `IND_CHN_USA.html` (comparisons)

## What I Learned

* How to process time-series data using Pandas
* Writing loops and functions to generate many visualizations automatically
* Using Plotly to make clear, good-looking charts
* How to turn raw data into useful insights with just Python

## About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm Jyoti Kamal.
I‚Äôm learning data analysis using Python and SQL by building small projects like this.
This one helped me practice both logic building and data storytelling through charts.
